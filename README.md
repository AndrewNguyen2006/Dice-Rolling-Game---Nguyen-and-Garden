# Project Title

Dice-Rolling-Game - Nguyen and Garden

## Description

This a simple dice rolling game in the style of black jack where you roll "dice" until you get as close to 100 as possible, or go over.  The player goes first until they have achieved a score that they feel comfortable with, to which the computer would then go and try to beat the player's score.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Windows 10 or any Apple product will work
* Recommended Python Version: 3.9. 1
* "Random" import will be downloaded

### Installing

* Use the shared link to access the program, or go on Github.com in order to find the program

### Executing program

* When you first run the code, it downloads the needed modules, with the only needed module for this being the random module.
* It will then prompt you type either "rules" or "begin".
  * type "begin" in order to begin the game with the computer.
  * type "rules" in order to pull up the needed rules to follow for the game.
* After typing "begin", it prompts you on what type of dice you would like to roll. To which you are able to pick "d10", "d12", and "d20" to roll.
  * However, you are always able to type "end" to end your turn and have the computer go while you stay with the score you got.
* The computer will then have its turn to which it will then use some basic statistics to determine if it should or shouldn't by generating a random number.
* At the end, the one closest to 100 without going over wins!
